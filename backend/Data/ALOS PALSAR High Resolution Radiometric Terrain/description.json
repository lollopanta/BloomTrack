    "description": "ASF's SAR Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) dataset gives terrestrial world-wide coverage; excluding Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, and Asia north of 60 degrees latitude. Users can analyze radiometry with the effects of topography removed. Topography can be analyzed with the effects of layover and shadow corrected. This SAR product works well with optical Landsat 8."
